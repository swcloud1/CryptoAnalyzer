# CryptoAnalyzer
Using a combination of webscrapers, APIs, custom algorithms and databases to look for CryptoCoins that are likely to increase in value over time.

# Problem Statement
Cryptocurrencies are the biggest hype in the world right now. There are thousands of different coin, each with their own promises and unique selling points. The problem is that each not a lot of markers are used to displayed how big the chance of the coins' success are. And even if there was, everyone would be using those markers, thus intervening with its effects.

# Proposed Solution
Using multiple custom webscrapers and APIs, indicators of a coins success are created and uploaded to a Firebase database. This database is used for the IOS app, in which all coins will be shows in a table, and the user will be able to sort the list by there preferred markers. The custom markers will be displayed alongside other markers in a graph. 

If enough time is left, users will be able to register and add certain coins to a watchlist.
